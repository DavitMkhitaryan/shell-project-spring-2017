iterate shell
-------------

This is iterate project for `C/C++` experience; we are making a `UNIX`

Your code should be implemented in the `.cpp` files with an
appropriate API exposed in the respective `.h` file.

The project uses `clang` and `fsantize` so you'll need to have these
installed on your machine, use `aptitude`
